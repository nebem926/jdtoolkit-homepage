	This zine was made by me, Mareike Nebel, with insight and artwork from friends.
I designed the entire magazine in Adobe InDesign and gathered all the content for interviews,
along with photoshopping photos of myself and making QR Codes for my friends content in the zine.
My zine, "ATARAXIA" focuses on the process and change in teenagers and their art before and during a global pandemic.
Not only will I say this but my friends who I interviewed will agree that art helped us have a clear mind this year
during a time where everything has been unknown but it's important to have an outlet to escape in.
